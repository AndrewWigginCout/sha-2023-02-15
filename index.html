<p>This app will deterministically generate passwords using a string as a seed.
Suggested usage is to find a random excerpt from a random book that you can remember.
Then you will be able to reconstruct your passwords in the future in case you forget them.
Since each password has a random word from a pool of 2^16 words and a random punctuation mark,
numeral, and character, each password is about 15 bits of entropy. Notice that the passwords
have uppercase, lowercase, digits and punctuation marks in them using the entire ASCII space. 
This will slow a potential brute force attack.</p>
<p>The hexadecimals in the output are the intermediate seed to generate the password.
The password itself is the english word followed by the "cherry" of 3 characters.</p>
<p>But the hexadecimal number contains the same information.</p>
<p>The calculation is done locally, but you should take care to vet that statement 
and be warned not to trust random apps with your passwords.</p>
